# Reason Dojo October

Main theme for today: Building interactive webapps with `ReasonReact.reducerComponents`

## Today we want to learn following topics:

- Build an App entry point with asynchronous state
- Promise handling
- Writing bindings to features of The Platform(tm)
- Deploy and Review the results with Netlify

## Exercise

We want to build a webpage which involves a lot of animation of image related content.
Since images load asynchronously, it might happen that some images are not loaded before the animation begins.
We need a component which handles a preloading mechanism to load certain images before the app is being launched.

**We define following React based API:**

```
// JS syntax!
<Preloader images={[img1, img2]} render={<div>Hello World</div>} />
```

**Features:**
- The Preloader should show a spinner as long as there are images loading
- After all resources are loaded, the render function should render the given component

**Rules:**
- NO RESEARCH / USAGE OF EXISTING LIBS ALLOWED
- Only use ReasonReact and the native JS APIs
